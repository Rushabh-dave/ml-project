Movie Recommendation System


A content-based movie recommendation system built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.  
It recommend movies similar to the selected one by user based on TF-IDF vector and cosine similarity of movie metadata such as overview, genre, director, and  top 3 cast.

Dataset:The dataset io used is IMDB+TOP1000_movies.csv from Kaggle
Link for Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows

- Interactive **Streamlit web app**.
- Select any movie from the IMDb Top 1000 dataset.
- Get **Top 5 similar movie recommendations** instantly.
- Displays **movie posters + titles** for better UX.
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** for recommendations.

### Current Limitations:
- Heavily reliant on metadata quality (overviews, actor names, genres, etc.).
- Does not use collaborative filtering or personalization.
- picture quality is low 
### Potential Upgrades:

- Combine with collaborative filtering for more personalized recommendations.
- Add richer metadata (like plot keywords, user ratings, or runtime).
- Implement caching or precomputed similarity matrices for faster responses.
- Enable user feedback integration to improve recommendation relevance.
