Movie Recommendation System


A content-based movie recommendation system built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.  
It recommend movies similar to the selected one by user based on TF-IDF vector and cosine similarity of movie metadata such as overview, genre, director, and  top 3 cast.

Dataset:The dataset io used is IMDB+TOP1000_movies.csv from Kaggle
Link for Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows

## ðŸš€ Features
- Interactive **Streamlit web app**.
- Select any movie from the IMDb Top 1000 dataset.
- Get **Top 5 similar movie recommendations** instantly.
- Displays **movie posters + titles** for better UX.
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** for recommendations.

  ##  Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or above

### Install Dependencies
```bash```
pip install -r requirements.txt

  
## File Struture
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Streamlit application frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ recommender.py         # Recommendation logic using TF-IDF & cosine similarity
â”œâ”€â”€ movies.pkl             # Preprocessed movie metadata (pickled DataFrame)
â”œâ”€â”€ imdb_top_1000.csv      # Raw IMDb Top 1000 movies dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # Project documentation (this file)

### Run The app locally 
  - streamlit run app.py



### Current Limitations:
- Heavily reliant on metadata quality (overviews, actor names, genres, etc.).
- Does not use collaborative filtering or personalization.

### Potential Upgrades:

- Combine with collaborative filtering for more personalized recommendations.
- Add richer metadata (like plot keywords, user ratings, or runtime).
- Implement caching or precomputed similarity matrices for faster responses.
- Enable user feedback integration to improve recommendation relevance.
